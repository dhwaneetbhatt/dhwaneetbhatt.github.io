I’ve been a [Postman](https://postman.com) user since 2013, and I’ve always loved the simplicity and power it offered for the day-to-day work I was doing which at the time was building internal APIs and testing them in different environments.

I’ve spent close to 10 years in the software industry - both as an individual contributor and a people leader. I’ve seen the industry shift from siloed business systems to business systems talking to each other unlocking more capabilities than ever before. APIs enable this complex web of communication between disparate business systems.

In the last couple of years, I’ve seen fintech very closely. APIs are enabling not only companies, but entire ecosystems of businesses to be built on top of them. Some examples are [Open Banking](https://www.openbankingeurope.eu/) in EU, [UPI stack](https://www.indiastack.org/upi/) in India, the rise of [BaaS platforms](https://internationalbanker.com/banking/banking-as-a-service-baas-the-platform-approach-to-banking/) and [Stripe](https://stripe.com) becoming a [$95B company](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/14/stripe-valued-at-95-billion-in-600-million-funding-round.html).

As the API landscape keeps maturing, organizations will need to focus on the API development lifecycle just like it focused on SDLC and Agile two decades ago. Like how [JIRA](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) is ubiquitous to SDLC, Postman is uniquely positioned to be the same for [API Development Life Cycle](https://www.postman.com/use-cases/api-first-development/).

I’m proud to be joining the incredible team at Postman and help build tools that enable companies to make better software and APIs.
