There is a dialogue in the movie Captain America: The First Avenger when Dr. Erskine is explaining to Steve Rogers why he was chosen for the super-soldier serum. Dr. Erskine says, "The serum amplifies everything that is inside. Good becomes great; bad becomes worse." The same thing applies to AI coding assistants. Good developers write better code, and bad developers spew out garbage faster.
