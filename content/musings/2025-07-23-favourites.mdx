My daughter keeps watching her favorite episode of Bluey on repeat, even though she remembers every scene by heart. She laughs and giggles with the same enthusiasm as if it were the first time. In this age of endless content and impermanence, it is remarkable that we can return to our favorite things and find joy without worrying we're missing out on everything else.
