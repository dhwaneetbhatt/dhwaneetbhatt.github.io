I am a Software Engineer with experience of working in startups and large organizations. My expertise is back-end development and cloud architecture.

I started my career building and maintaining web applications and backend systems for [Sokrati](https://sokrati.com). Tech stack was based on Java and MySQL and we were writing services that interacted with Google AdWords and Facebook Exchange (FBX) APIs to serve ads. I was part of the oncall rotation team and I got exposure to a lot of internal tools for deployment, monitoring and end-to-end testing.

At [Birst](https://birst.com), (birst.com before being acquired by [Infor](https://infor.com)), I was building backend systems in Java. I was actively involved in DevOps and helped maintain CI/CD pipelines on Jenkins that deployed to AWS. Led multiple teams before moving on.

At present, I am the Head of Engineering at [Novo](https://banknovo.com), a fintech startup building products for small and medium businesses in the US. I lead the engineering team in building features and core infrastructure.
