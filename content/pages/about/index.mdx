Hello üëã, I am Dhwaneet, and I live in [Ahmedabad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad) with my family. My native place is [Bhavnagar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhavnagar).

I started programming with C in 2006. The most complex program I wrote that year was a Tower of Hanoi algorithm and a DOS-based graphics screen showing the disks moving step-by-step that looked like [this](https://tedmuller.us/FunAndGames/img/TowerOfHanoi.gif). I qualified for [INOI in 2006](https://www.iarcs.org.in/inoi/2006/inoi2006/results_inoi2006.php) by brute-forcing a O(n<sup>3</sup>) solution in the qualifying round. However, I did not know what "algorithms" were at that age, so I terribly failed the training camp for the International Olympiad. I graduated in Computer Science in 2011.

Since then, I've worked in small and medium sized startups and have specialised in backend and web.

I spend most of my time outside of work with my family. In the remaining time, I try to follow up on my hobbies.

I read non-fiction [books](/books). I read a lot of different topics. I believe that knowledge helps me become a better human.

I watch sci-fi TV shows and movies. I like the comic universe and usually end up watching anything that is Marvel or DC Comics based.

I listen to podcasts. Some of my favourite ones are [Huberman Labs](https://hubermanlab.com/welcome-to-the-huberman-lab-podcast/) and [Naval](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9uYXZhbC5saWJzeW4uY29tL3Jzcw).

I have come to enjoy running and try to do that at least two times a week. I also like learning about health and food.
