I started programming with C in 2006 and the most complex program I wrote that year was a Tower of Hanoi algorithm along with a DOS based graphics screen that showed the disks moving step-by-step that looked something like [this](https://tedmuller.us/FunAndGames/img/TowerOfHanoi.gif). I qualified for [INOI in 2006](https://www.iarcs.org.in/inoi/2006/inoi2006/results_inoi2006.php) by brute forcing a O(n<sup>3</sup>) solution in the qualifying round, although I did not know what "algorithms" were at that age so I terribly failed the training camp for the International Olympiad. I graduated with Computer Science in 2011.

I started my career building and maintaining web applications and backend systems for [Sokrati](https://sokrati.com). I was also part of the oncall rotation team and I got exposure to a lot of internal tools for deployment, monitoring and end-to-end testing.

At [Birst](https://birst.com) (later acquired by [Infor](https://infor.com)), I was building backend systems and APIs for product features and was actively involved in evolving and scaling production infrastructure.

I was a Backend Engineer and then eventually the Head of Engineering at [Novo](https://banknovo.com). I led the engineering team in building features and core infrastructure from Seed to Series A.

Currently I am a Staff Engineer at [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), doing my part in building an API development platform loved by developers all around the world.
