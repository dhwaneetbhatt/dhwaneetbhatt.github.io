I was mostly into reading fiction books during school and college, but these days I primarily focus on non-fiction and software engineering, and read fiction from time to time.

I try to summarize the content and pen down my learnings from these books [here](https://dhwaneetbhatt.notion.site/Books-981a74d2f7434235970d4a2849654f06).
