## Hi.

I'm Dhwaneet Bhatt - a software engineer who has found peace living in [Ahmedabad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad). I take interest in backend engineering and building infrastructure and like to contribute to open source whenever I can.

I started programming at 16 with C and the most complex program I wrote that year was a Tower of Hanoi algorithm along with a DOS based graphics screen that showed the disks moving step-by-step that looked something like [this](https://tedmuller.us/FunAndGames/img/TowerOfHanoi.gif).

I've taken up numerous roles in companies of all sizes and have been an individual contributor as well as a people manager. Currently I am a Staff Engineer at [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), building an API development platform loved by developers all around the world.
